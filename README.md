This will take you to a page with different download options. (I selected the option for apple silicon installer)<br>
One it's done downloading click on the icon, move it to the applications folder and go ahead with the instalation process (press continue)<br>
Once it's installed you have to make an account in order to gain access to the software.<br>
Go to https://www.jetbrains.com/community/education/#students and click apply now.<br>
Fill in the form with your information. It will ask you for a picture of your id. Then it will take some time to approve your request. (It took less than an hour for me)<br>
Once your account is confirmed you can log in into your account.<br>
